# Microchip-AVR-VUSB-2020-renew

Firmware of the Atmega328 example is shown in the "atmega328_prj" with Microchip studio latest version supported on Windows OS platform.

The usb control on PC side is using python script rather than old C program as libusb-1.0 is tedious and hard to linkup and version support might not be easy.

The packed exe is enclosed on this example where the spec will give user a good example how to due with the error and dll linkage during pyinstaller.

This example only provide simple command line interface, while tkinter can be used to enhance the interface as well.

As always have fun =]
